### STEP 1: Getting familiar with documentation and writing my first HelloWorld progrmam
## I will be downloading Rust from https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html, if you want to follow my journey.

First off I'm downloading rustup to start learning.
To install it I launched rustup, and installed using Visual Studio installer, following the tutorial.

# Next up Fist Program!
To make our first program we will create a file "hello_world.rs". Rust languge programs have extension ending with .rs (Importanat).

Our first program will look something like this:


fn main(){
    println!("Hello, World!");
}


Very elementry syntax.
