### STEP2 Creating a cargo
## We are still following the tutorial of https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html. This is the 1.3 step

So We are making a project With Cargo. It is the way to start a new Rust project. /src/ has our main, in Cargo.toml is the settnings file where we put our dependancies for out project. We start the project by running command "cargo build". We compiled our project into another folder "target" where we can see our hello_cargo.exe! Running it we can see our Hello, world! Neat.

We can run our project by simply typing *"cargo run"*

For now I will leave the cargo in the second step folder and write what I'm doing each time in the following folders with snippets of code that are written in this cargo project.



# Small things I've noticed
The main thing is the whole process is quite easy to follow, but now it seems that i to learn how this whole build process works and how to compile my stuff. I'm a 1st year student in Vilnius University Software engineer (Program≈≥ Sistemos is the name for my major) and had a class with Java, so it seems to me that this is a familar conscept of building a project. Theese are my current thoughts as of Doing this Step.
